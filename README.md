Greetings Professor,

I am delighted to present my Advanced Artificial Neural Networks Final Project to you!

I wanted to bring to your attention a minor adjustment regarding the accessibility of my project. Originally, it was crafted and executed on Google Colab. However, I understand that downloading the files from Colab might be time-consuming. To ensure a seamless experience for you as the grader, I have provided a Kaggle link where you can effortlessly access and run the code because in the input section, the dataset is present. Make sure you use GPU and utilize the 'turn internet on' feature on Kaggle. The final report, "Refined Brain Tumor Detection with Adapted Deep CNN 3 Architecture" was created based off of the results ran in Collab (view collab notebook).  Using sklearn.utils.shuffle along with a defined random_state parameter can introduce variability into the classification reports. Keep this in mind when executing the Kaggle notebook to understand potential fluctuations in the results. Moreover, I utilized the input feature on Kaggle to facilitate the downloading of the Br35H dataset, simplifying the process for your convenience.
