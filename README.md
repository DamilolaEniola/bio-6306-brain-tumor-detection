Greetings Professor,

I am delighted to present my Advanced Artificial Neural Networks Final Project to you!

I wanted to bring to your attention a minor adjustment regarding the accessibility of my project. Originally, it was crafted and executed on Google Colab. However, I understand that downloading the files from Colab might be time-consuming. To ensure a seamless experience for you as the grader, I have provided a Kaggle link where you can effortlessly access and run the code.

Moreover, I utilized the input feature on Kaggle to facilitate the downloading of the Br35H dataset, simplifying the process for your convenience.


Warm regards,
Damilola Eniola Olowu
